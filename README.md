Master Thesis for the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at UPM.

The goal is to study how ideas spread inside an online community. 
To achieve this, I'm applying Natural Language processing techniques to texts that have been posted on a community from January 2020 to May 2020.

This project is made in Python.
For the language processing I'm using Scikit-learn and I'm planing to use also spaCy.
For the user interface, I'm using Django.
